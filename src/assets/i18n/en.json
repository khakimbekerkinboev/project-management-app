Doing it manually or using spreadsheets and over emails is definitely not an efficient way of doing it and brings its own set of challenges. However, when you use a project tracking software, all communication is in one centralized place, and it’s easy to assign tasks and define priorities. It becomes easy to keep track of your team’s work and ensures that projects are progressing as planned."
